    "- Query efficiently with indices.  \n",
    "- Understand soft vs. hard deletes and archival.  \n",

    "  - Hard-delete dishes with confirmation and cascading (e.g., remove clam chowder and related bread bowl + clam ingredients).  \n",
    "  - Run aggregation queries to reveal top ingredients, average calories by city, and how many chowders were archived.  \n",
