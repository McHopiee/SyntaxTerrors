    "### 1. `drawText` Improvements\n",
    "- **Before:** `drawText` always used `30px Arial`, so all text (scores, win counters, messages) looked the same size.  \n",
    "- **After:** Added a `size` parameter so text size can be customized.  \n",
    "```js\n",
    "function drawText(text, x, y, color = \"white\", size = 30) {\n",
    "    ctx.fillStyle = color;\n",
    "    ctx.font = `${size}px Arial`;\n",
    "    ctx.fillText(text, x, y);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This allows **scores** to stay large while **win counters** are smaller (18px).\n"

    "let player2Wins = parseInt(localStorage.getItem(\"pongPlayer2Wins\") || \"0\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Added `saveWin(winner)` function to update counters when a match ends.  \n",
    "- Displayed above the canvas in **yellow**, smaller than main scores:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "drawText(\"P1 Wins: \" + player1Wins, 50, 30, \"yellow\", 18);\n",
    "drawText(\"P2 Wins: \" + player2Wins, canvas.width - 200, 30, \"yellow\", 18);\n",
