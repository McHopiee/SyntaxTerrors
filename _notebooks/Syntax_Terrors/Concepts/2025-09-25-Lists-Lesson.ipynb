    "### 1. Introduction  \n",
    "A **list** is a way to store multiple values inside a single variable. Think of it like a row of lockers: one name (the list) holds many items (the values). Lists are super useful for games like **Snake, Pong, Tic Tac Toe, or Cookie Clicker**, because you often need to keep track of many things at once â€” like player positions, scores, or objects on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Key Concepts  \n",
    "- **Indexing**: Each item in a list has a position, starting at `0`.  \n",
    "- **Appending**: Adding new items to a list.  \n",
    "- **Iteration**: Going through each item in a list with a loop.  \n",
    "- **Mutable**: Lists can be changed (add, remove, update).\n",

    "### 3. Example in Python\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A list of high scores in a game\n",
    "scores = [100, 200, 300]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access items\n",
    "print(\"Top score:\", scores[0])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a new score\n",
    "scores.append(400)\n",
    "print(\"Updated scores:\", scores)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loop through scores\n",
    "for score in scores:\n",
    "    print(\"Score:\", score)\n"
